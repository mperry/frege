 * Support for ad hoc parallelism in Frege through java's ForkJoin mechanism
 -}

{--
    Native operation to fork evaluation of some lazy value.

    A ForkJoinTask will be created and forked unless
    the value is already evaluated.

    When the ForkJoinTask begins execution it will invoke the @call()@ method
    of the @frege.runtime.Lazy@ instance that was passed as value.
    The sole purpose of @call@ is to make an @Lazy@ implement the
    Java @Callable@ interface, it just evaluates the lazy value in the
    usual way. Because evaluation is synchronized, any attempts to evaluate the
    value from other tasks will block until evaluation is complete and the
    @Lazy@ is updated.

    We pass the value as partial applied function to avoid evaluation.
