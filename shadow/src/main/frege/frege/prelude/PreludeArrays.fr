--- short hand for 'Mutable' @s@ ('JArray' @a@)
type ArrayOf s a = Mutable s (JArray a)

{--
    The type @JArray X@ corresponds to Java's @J[]@ for any type @X@
    where @J@ is the corresponding java type of @X@,
    but note that Java does not really have generic arrays.
    
    We can use arrays generically inside Frege, but native code 
    that expects or returns arrays will not be generic.  
    
    The native interface will take every occurrence of
    
    > JArray X
    
    or
    
    > Mutable s (JArray X)
    
    in native declarations to denote the corresponding Java array type.
    But when the type argument is variable, it will be just @Object@.
    This corresponds to the usage in 
    'http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/lang/reflect/Array.html the array reflection API'.

    Multi-dimensional arrays are not very well supported out of the box.
    If one needs more than 1 dimensions, the type will get quite complex,
    as of course arrays are mutable and so one will have multiple levels
    of 'JArray' nested in 'Mutable' nested in 'JArray' and so forth.
    Moreover, multi-dimensional arrays cannot be generic at all.
    
    Note that there are really 2 different APIs: 
    
    1. With the 'JArray.getElemAt', 'JArray.getAt', 'JArray.setAt', 'JArray.setElemAt',
    'JArray.itemAt' and 'JArray.elemAt' it is possible to work on Java objects with
    java compile time type @java.lang.Object@ *or* @X[]@ for some java type @X@
    *or* @java.lang.Object[]@, 
    but the run time type is always @java.lang.Object[]@. 
    2. With the 'newArray', 'getElemAt', 'getAt', 'setAt', 
    'setElemAt', 'itemAt' and 'elemAt' functions of the 'ArrayElem' class
    for some type @F@ that is an instance of 'ArrayElem', 
    we can work on Java objects with
    Java compile time type @X[]@, 
    where @X@ is the Java type corresponding to @F@,    
    but the run time type is always @X[]@.    
    
    The former ones are usable only in polymorphic functions where the type argument 
    for 'JArray' is a variable and we don't (want to) have 'ArrayElem' constraints. 
    They are not good for interfacing native methods that take or return arrays of a certain type.
    Run time type errors are possible because native methods could put anything there.
    However, when used in Frege only, the typing is safe.
    
    The latter ones are truly type safe, because their Frege type corresponds to the
    expected Java compile time type, which is also the actual run time type.  
    
    Here is a cheat sheet for the different array get and set methods:
    
    >             Array type            Argument/    Description
    >                                   Result
     
    > setAt       Mutable (JArray s X)  Maybe X     set null or data element
    > setElemAt   Mutable (JArray s X)  X           set data element
    > getAt       Mutable (JArray s X)  Maybe X     get null or data element
    > getElemAt   Mutable (JArray s X)  X           get data element (unsafe)
    > itemAt      JArray s X            Maybe X     get null or data element (pure)
    > elemAt      JArray s X            X           get data element (pure, unsafe)
    
    "unsafe" in this context applies only to non-primitive types
    and means that the function will fail with a @NullPointerException@
    if the value accessed is a Java @null@.
